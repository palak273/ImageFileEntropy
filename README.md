# FileEntropy
Calculating file entropies using NIST 800-90b
The imageArray file calculate entropies for an array of images and 
plots them in a graph.
The entropies are calculated using statistic-based measurements:
Most common value estimates, 
Collision test estimates, 
Markov test estimates, and
Compression test estimates.
